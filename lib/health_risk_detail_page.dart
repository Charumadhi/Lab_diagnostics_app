        {'name': 'Lipid Screen Cholesterol And Triglycerides Serum Test', 'price': '₹475', 'parameters': '1','description': "The Lipid Panel, also known as the Lipid Screen Cholesterol and Triglycerides Serum Test, is a crucial diagnostic tool used to assess an individual's risk of cardiovascular disease by measuring levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Cholesterol is essential for various bodily functions but high levels can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Triglycerides, another type of lipid, serve as a source of energy but elevated levels can also contribute to cardiovascular risk. This test involves a simple blood draw, typically taken after fasting for accurate results, providing valuable insights into an individual's lipid profile and cardiovascular health status. Regular lipid screenings are recommended to monitor and manage these risk factors effectively."},
        {'name': 'Lipid Profile 3 (Non-Fasting)', 'price': '₹545', 'parameters': '1','description':"The Lipid Profile 3 (Non-Fasting) test is a variant of the standard lipid profile that is conducted without the requirement of fasting beforehand. This test measures various lipids in the blood, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (often called 'good' cholesterol), LDL cholesterol ('bad' cholesterol), and triglycerides. Unlike the traditional fasting lipid profile, which requires abstaining from food for 9-12 hours prior to the test for accurate results, the non-fasting lipid profile can be performed at any time of the day without fasting. It is particularly useful for individuals who may find it challenging to fast or for routine screenings where fasting may not be feasible. However, it's important to note that non-fasting lipid profiles may show slightly higher triglyceride levels compared to fasting tests, but they still provide valuable information about lipid levels and cardiovascular health."},
        {'name': 'Lipid Profile - Mini Test', 'price': '₹800', 'parameters': '10','description':"The Lipid Profile - Mini Test is a condensed version of the standard lipid profile, focusing on key lipid parameters essential for assessing cardiovascular health.

It's used to evaluate the integrity and function of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and to monitor the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin. During the test, a healthcare provider draws blood from a vein, typically in the arm. The blood sample is then mixed with thromboplastin and calcium ions in a laboratory setting. The time it takes for the blood to clot is measured in seconds. Results are usually reported as the PT time in seconds and as the International Normalized Ratio (INR), which standardizes PT results to account for variations in thromboplastin reagents used between labs. Abnormal PT results may indicate a bleeding disorder, liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or the presence of anticoagulant medications. PT testing is essential in managing patients on anticoagulant therapy to maintain a therapeutic level of blood thinning while minimizing the risk of bleeding complications."},

        {'name': 'Calcium Score Test (Heart Scan)', 'price': '₹5000', 'parameters': '1','description':"The Calcium Score Test, also known as a Heart Scan or Coronary Calcium Scan, is a specialized diagnostic test used to assess the amount of calcium deposits in the coronary arteries of the heart. These deposits, called calcifications, can indicate the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and potential future risk of heart attacks. During the test, a computed tomography (CT) scanner takes detailed images of the heart to detect and quantify these calcifications. The test is non-invasive and involves lying flat on a table while the scanner takes rapid X-ray images of the heart and chest area. It typically takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and does not require any needles or injections. The results of the Calcium Score Test are given as a score or number that reflects the severity of calcium buildup in the coronary arteries. Higher scores indicate more significant calcifications and a higher risk of coronary artery disease. This information helps healthcare providers assess a patient's cardiovascular health and develop appropriate preventive or treatment strategies to reduce the risk of heart disease. The Calcium Score Test is particularly beneficial for individuals with risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or a family history of heart disease. "}
